# Smart Parcel Sorting Conveyor System using QR Identification & IoT Notification

An IoT-enabled smart logistics system designed to automate parcel sorting using QR code-based identification and real-time cloud notifications.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a smart conveyor-based parcel sorting system using the ESP32-CAM module for QR code recognition and servo-controlled gates for automated parcel routing.

The system scans QR codes attached to parcels, extracts customer details and destination information, and dynamically sorts them into designated bins using a servo-actuated conveyor mechanism.
